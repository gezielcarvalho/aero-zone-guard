**Aero Zone Guard - Airspace Construction Assessment System**

## Problem Description

The Aero Zone Guard is a software solution designed to automate the analysis and assessment of construction projects in relation to their potential impact on aviation safety and airspace management. Whether it's a new building, antenna, or airport, the system evaluates potential threats and interference with existing aviation infrastructure before authorizing construction. Developed to streamline the reception, analysis, and decision-making process, this software facilitates the flow of electronic documentation through various sectors of the aeronautical authority, ultimately leading to the issuance or denial of clearance for the proposed project.

## System Capabilities

The new system should be capable of:

• **Automated Documentation Reception**: Allowing for the submission of electronic documentation related to construction projects, including geographic coordinates, elevation data, and physical characteristics of airports and obstacles.

• **Pre-Analysis Based on Geographic Data**: Using geographic coordinates and elevation information to perform pre-analysis and assess potential threats and interference with existing aviation infrastructure.

• **Workflow Management**: Managing the flow of documentation through different sectors of the aeronautical authority, ensuring timely processing and review by relevant stakeholders.

• **Decision Emission**: Facilitating the emission of a final decision by the aeronautical authority, either granting clearance for the construction project or issuing a denial based on aviation safety concerns.

## Business Benefits

It is anticipated that the deployment of this new system will provide the following business benefits:

• **Increased Efficiency**: Streamlining the reception, analysis, and decision-making process for construction projects, leading to faster and more accurate assessments.

• **Enhanced Safety**: Ensuring that potential threats and interference with aviation infrastructure are identified and mitigated before construction begins.

• **Improved Communication**: Facilitating better communication and coordination between different sectors of the aeronautical authority.

• **Regulatory Compliance**: Helping to ensure that construction projects comply with aviation safety regulations and standards.
